# google-image-scraper
With a user inputted url the script will download the first 20 images from the page.



## Problems
The scraper only gets the image that is displayed, so it is low quality. In order to correct this I need to be able to access the source of the image once you've clicked on it to downloaded the higher quality file, as this displays the jpg version of that specific image.
This could be done by getting the id of the image and adding it to the end of the url.
